# An overview of statistial learning
*Statistical learning* refers to a vast set of tools for understanding
data.

Two categories: *supervised* and *unsupervised*.

<code>Supervised</code>: Build models based on **known** input and output data, then use the model
for prediction or estimation.

<code>Unsupervised</code>: There are inputs but no supervised outputs. We can learn
relationships and structures from such data.

## Notation and simple algebra

The $ X_{ij} $ represents the value for the $ jth $ variable for the $ ith $
observation, where $ i=1,2,...n $ and $ j=1,2,...n $.

## get the R package
