In this chapter, we study approaches for predicting qualitative responses, a process that is known as `classification`. Predicting a qualitative response for an obervation can be refered to as *classifying* that observation, since it involves assigning the observation to a category, or class. On the other hand, often the methods used for classification first predict the probability of each of the categories of a qualitative variable, as the basis for making the classification. In this sense they also behave like regression methods.

We will first discuss three of the most widely used classifiers: `logistic regression`, `linear discriminant anlaysis`, and `K-nearest neighbors`.
