# Ingredients:

* 8 oz penne pasta cooked according to package instructions
* 2 TBSPs extra virgin olive oil
* 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts pounded thin
* 1 1/2 TBSPs Cajun seasoning divided
* 2 TBSPs unsalted butter
* 2 cloves garlic minced
* 1 TBSP all purpose flour
* 1 1/2 cups half and half
* 1/3 cup grated parmesan plus more for topping
* salt and pepper to taste
* 1 diced tomato
* fresh parsley chopped

# Instructions
* While the pasta is cooking, heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
* Season the chicken on both sides with 1 TBSP Cajun seasoning. Add to the skillet. Cook for about three minutes on each side or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees.
* Remove the chicken from the skillet, clean it, and return it to the medium heat.
* Melt the butter, add the garlic and saut√©e for about 30 seconds. Whisk in the flour and cook it for another 30 seconds. Very slowly add the half and half, initially about a tablespoon at a time, so the sauce thickens. Add more quickly after you have added about half a cup.
* Stir in the parmesan cheese and allow it melt completely. Add the remaining 1/2 TBSP Cajun seasoning and season with salt and pepper to taste.
* Add the penne to the sauce, top with tomatoes, parsley, parmesan cheese, and the sliced cooked chicken.

Enjoy immediately!
